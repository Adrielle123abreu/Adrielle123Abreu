# Hi! I'am Adrielle Abreu ðŸ˜„
### About me

 #### Currently, I am a Business Administration student at FEA-USP, with a strong enthusiasm for technology and finance. I strive to integrate these two fields as much as possible in my work by developing skills in languages such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Additionally, I am deepening my knowledge in data analysis and programming to further enhance my competencies.
